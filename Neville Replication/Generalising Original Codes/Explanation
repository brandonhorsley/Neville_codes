This folder is for generalisations I did to the original code to allow inputs of arbitrary circuits, 
to avoid hardcoding in the circuits and having to change a bunch of things in the code. gen_Aux_Nev applies 
this generalisation to Aux_Nev, gen_MainCode implements the arbitrary circuit input but it still restricted 
to two modes, v2 was for generalising to more output modes but I'm uncertain if I finished debugging it. 
Restructured.py is a later entry where I tidied up the generalised code as it was sloppy in places, like finding 
the probability then taking the log, rather than just taking the logprob directly. The testing folder tests gen_MainCode 
and Restructured on a beamsplitter and phase shifter.
