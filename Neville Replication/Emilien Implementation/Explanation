Following continued trouble with getting my codes to work as intended, I pivoted to using (the then postdoc) 
Emilien's code and fleshing it out to contain all of the Alex Neville protocol as originally he had only written 
in the metropolis algorithm for sampling. This first implementation is BSPS_coherentstate.py, covering a beamsplitter 
and phase shifter to be characterised. However he uses a coherent state input and uses the analytical expression for the 
click probability as a result.
