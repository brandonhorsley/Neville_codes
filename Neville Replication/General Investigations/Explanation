A mixture of investigations I did during my PhD proess of trying to replicated Neville's work. 
Earlier entries were ParamRuntimeScaling which was me just recording the runtime of my code for different 
parameters to characterised and different MCMC chain length to get a rough sense of the situation. 
ExploringPosterior was getting a sense of the posterior geometry from a uniform prior and multinomial likelihood. 
PriorInv_unfinished was a good point of trialling different priors but I didn't get round to this too much and is 
thus unfinished and a bit of a mess. DetuningInv was a later entry once I pinned down multimodality/identifiability as 
the source of my woes, so I wanted to get a sense of what detuning of each parameter could lead to convergence on the 
wrong set of parameters.
