This folder contains the varied parts of the curve fitting approach. MLE_PSfit.py is the original 
implementation, using scipy's inbuilt curve_fit function. bayesianPS.py is the original Bayesian version 
of the curve fitting algorithm by putting priors on the parameters to infer. Scipy's curve fitting function doesn't 
allow regularisation so curveasmin.py reexpresses the curve fitting problem as it's equivalent minimisation problem 
formulation. FullBayesCharacterisation is virtually equivalent to bayesianPS, FullBayesHardcoded is 
FullBayesCharacterisation but the process of doing this to navigate a whole unitary chip is hardcoded in 
(this runs but gave poor performance, partly I think due to needing a point estimate to set an MZI to as part of the 
full process which kind of undermines the bayesian approach). FullMLEHardcoded was to see if the same problem still held 
for the MLE implementation.
