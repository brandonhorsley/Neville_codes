"""
This code file i have opened as a seperate version to gen_MainCode where i will generalise to more output modes. 
Some parts should be easy like defining the unitaries but the automation of input will be more awkward since i 
would need beamsplitters as well as what modes they will be across as well as perhaps imposing simple checks like 
not allowing beamsplitters to be over non-adjacent modes.
