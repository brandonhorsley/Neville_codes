MISvsHMC was for a comparison analysis between MIS and the HMC algorithm but ultimately unfinished since I was 
using sampling boson sampling distribution as an example which MIS is fine for since you can explicitly make it so 
that proposals are valid (no gain or loss of photons) and is fine for discrete probability spaces but HMC is for 
continuous probability spaces and final state in trajectory being valid could be a major challenge to enforce so 
didn't finish. SMC_Inv was toying with PyMC's sequential monte carlo (SMC) routine since it is better at handling 
multimodality than HMC but I think I didn't finish debugging. AR_Inv was an example code about time series which I 
think was about thinking that maybe the count data modelling could be done as a time series and maybe causal inference. 
Ultimately abandoned due to lack of time to investigate as would basically be a distinct project.
