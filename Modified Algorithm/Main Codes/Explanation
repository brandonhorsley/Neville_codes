Mod_BSPS is the original main code, applying the modified algorithm to a beamsplitter and phase shifter. 
Hierarch.py is the code file where I toyed with hierarchical modelling to alleviate issues. Polished.py should 
have solved an issue I was having where PyMC doesn't like complex gradients which are detected by complex entries 
occurring in the unitary (even though the probability is real), so one way to handle this is to manage the real and 
imaginary components separately then recombine accordingly at the end. Note this is the reason for the inordinately 
long p in Hierarch.py, related to the Scaling Up subfolder.
