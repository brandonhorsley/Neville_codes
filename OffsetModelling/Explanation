Old analysis excel file was a mistaken one I did where I used RibWaveguide lumerical file but assumed all the data pertained to a 500nm SOI rib waveguide due to the starting entries and the results for that indicated the same conclusion of a very long length needed for the offset term to be a uniform distribution, however it occurred to me during my results writeup that maybe this wasn't the case and so I redid the analysis in the file labelled 'new' where I attempted to find which data sets corresponded to which of the standard components. Fortunately the results were similar.
