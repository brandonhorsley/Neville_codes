"""
This code will be for practicing building a larger circuit (follow Reck 
scheme for simplicity and scaling number of modes) so that it can be 
assessed how the protocol performs as circuit size scales. As my measure 
of performance i will follow what NEville does by randomly setting true 
values for the circuits and measuring average error across multiple runs 
and i can use this to build a plot of average error vs circuit size. 
Alongside this perhaps a runtime analysis could be warranted for comparison.
