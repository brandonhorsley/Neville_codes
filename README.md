# Neville_codes
A collection of codes centred around reproducing figures from Alex Neville's thesis in 2018 and developing them further.

Current state of this repo is that older experimental codes are found under the 'Old' folder while the two prongs of this investigations have been divided into the 'Classic Sampling' and 'HMC Investigations' accordingly. Classic Sampling involves will now involve codes around using traditional sampling techniques for a new boson sampling project. HMC investigations will involve a personal project of using the pymc python library to use HMC for more scalable and efficient characterisation of photonic chips.
